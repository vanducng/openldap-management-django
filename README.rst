Motivation for development
--------------------------
Having been involved with the setup of Identity Providers which use open LDAP as the authentication backend, I am yet to
come across a FOSS solution for signing up users that provides a way for them to reset their passwords on their own.
This has been a pain point when setting up identity providers because the only alternative an admin has is to login to
the backend and manually reset their passwords.
There is a commercial solution (ldap-account-manager) which I haven't tried and that is my main motivation to build an
open solution. I haven't bothered with building an interface to manage LDAP since that already exists and I recommend
phpldapadmin (FOSS) for that.
